This project is a Fake News Detection system that can predict whether a piece of news is true or fake. I built and trained a machine learning model that analyzes news content and tells us how likely it is to be real or misleading.

The model provides an accuracy score, helping us understand how well it distinguishes between genuine and false news. In the future, I plan to integrate more advanced AI techniques to improve detection accuracy and make the tool even smarter.
